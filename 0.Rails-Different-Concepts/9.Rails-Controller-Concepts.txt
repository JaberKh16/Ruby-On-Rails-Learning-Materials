Rails Controller Based Learning Concepts
========================================
Rails provides controller based approach where it has the following functions

# app/controllers/product_controller.rb
class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @products = Product.all
  end
end


to see it in the view:

    <%# app/views/products/index.html.erb %>
    <%= debug @products %>    # debug prints the @products info in YAML format
