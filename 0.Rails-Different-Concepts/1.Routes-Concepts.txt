Rails Routing Concepts 
=======================
Route found will be found in the config/

    - config/routes.rb 

Syntax:
    Rails.application.routes.draw do
        # all routes goes here
    end


1. Root Route
    - the route which will be hits when client hit on the domain 

    root to: 'home#index'  # Controller: home_controller.rb, Function:index, View:app/views/home/index.html.erb

2. Resources/Restful Routes
    - follows the restful(REST: Representational State Transfer) pattern by default
    - Let's say, you want to have the posts resource 

        resource :posts                         # single resources route 
        resource :posts, :categories, :tags     # multiple resources routes

    
    # GET   /posts -    posts#index -   display a list of all posts
    # GET   /posts/new -    posts#new - return an HTML form for creating a new posts
    # POST  /posts -    posts#create -  create a new posts
    # GET   /posts/:id -    posts#show -    display a specific posts
    # GET   /posts/:id/edit -   posts#edit -    return an HTML form for editing a posts
    # PATCH/PUT     /posts/:id -    posts#update -  update a specific posts
    # DELETE    /posts/:id -    posts#destroy - delete a specific posts


3. Resource (RESTful but singular)
    - Sometimes, you have a resource that clients always look up without referencing an ID. 
      So intead of /profile/1 it can be just /profile
    - Rails controller actions would include: show, new, create, edit, update,destroy


    # GET   /profile/new - profiles#new - return an HTML form for creating the profile
    # POST  /profile - profiles#create - create the new profile
    # GET   /profile - profiles#show - display the one and only profile resource
    # GET   /profile/edit - profiles#edit - return an HTML form for editing the profile
    # PATCH/PUT     /profile - profiles#update - update the one and only profile resource
    # DELETE    /profile - profiles#destroy -  delete the profile resource


4. Namespacing 
    - if want a specific path for a resource which contain inside a namespace
    - use case: common for private or admin areas of an app where need more control over the 
      url schema

    Syntax:
      namespace :admin do 
        resources :article
      end

    Populated:
        # GET   /admin/articles - admin/articles#index -    admin_articles_path
        # GET   /admin/articles/new - admin/articles#new -  new_admin_article_path
        # POST  /admin/articles -   admin/articles#create - admin_articles_path
        # GET   /admin/articles/:id -   admin/articles#show -   admin_article_path(:id)
        # GET   /admin/articles/:id/edit -  admin/articles#edit -   edit_admin_article_path(:id)
        # PATCH/PUT     /admin/articles/:id - admin/articles#update -   admin_article_path(:id)
        # DELETE    /admin/articles/:id - admin/articles#destroy -  admin_article_path(:id)

    - For even more organization you can add ruby modules to the mix to move your controller in the admin 
      space so your routing and controllers follow the same encapsulation patterns.

        Syntax:
            scope module 'admin' do
                resources :articles
            end

            # or

            resources :articles, module: :admin

        Populated:
            Your controller would then move to a module or in 
                app/controllers/admin/articles_controller.rb instead of just app/controllers/.

            Inside the controller you would write the class a bit differently to compensate

                Admin::ArticlesController < ApplicationController
                   ...
                end



5. Nesting Routes 
    - Simply nest like you would with a ruby block. It's recommended to never nest 3 levels 
      deep although it's possible.

        Syntax:
            resources :categories
                resources :posts 
            end

        Populated:
            # GET /categories/:category_id/posts
            # posts#index
            # display a list of all posts for a specific category
            # category_posts_path(@category) # requires an instance of Category

            # ----

            # GET /categories/:category_id/posts/new
            # posts#new
            # return an HTML form for creating a new post belonging to a specific category
            # new_category_post_path(@category) # requires an instance of Category

            # ----

            # POST /categories/:category_id/posts
            # posts#create
            # create a new post belonging to a specific category

            # ----

            # GET /categories/:category_id/posts/:id
            # posts#show
            # display a specific post belonging to a specific category
            # category_post_path(@category, @post) # requires an instance of Category and Post

            # ----

            # GET /categories/:category_id/posts/:id/edit
            # posts#edit
            # return an HTML form for editing an post belonging to a specific category
            # edit_category_post_path(@category, @post) # requires an instance of Category and Post

            # ----

            # PATCH/PUT /categories/:category_id/posts/:id
            # posts#update
            # update a specific post belonging to a specific category

            # ----

            # DELETE /categories/:category_id/posts/:id
            # posts#destroy
            # delete a specific post belonging to a specific category
            # category_post_path(@category, @post), method: :delete # requires an instance of Category and Post



6. Non Restful Routing
    - definig manual with path or function defined 
        Syntax:
            http_verb 'uri' , to: 'controller#function'
        Example:
            get 'posts/index', to: 'posts#index'
    
5. Default Return Routes 
    - when want some form of data to be return through the routes 
        Syntax:
            http_verb 'uri' , to: 'controller#function', defaults: { format: 'json' }
        Example:
            get 'posts/index', to: 'posts#index', defaults: { format: 'json' }

        Populated:
            Here Rails would match users/1 to the show action of UsersController, and 
            set params[:format] to json.

6. Naming Routes 
    - naming routes are the route which can be named user wants irrespectively of controller or path(function)
      logic.
    - basically helps to rename the path you like rather than the rails defaults

        Syntax:
            http_verb 'uri' , to: 'controller#function', as: 'name_route'
        Example:
            get 'posts/index', to: 'posts#index', as: 'index_post'
